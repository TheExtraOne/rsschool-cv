### About myself:
I’m a 25-years old person with relatively rich backgrounds, as I used to work as a surgeon in a State Institution "Minsk Scientific and Practical Center for Surgery, Transplantology and Hematology". 
My hard decision to leave medicine was a turning point, but I was totally obsessed by programming, so chose to be a risk taker—and thereby hangs a tale.
After completing "Basics of Computed Science" course, I acquired not only new skills, but also a sense of moving to the right direction and discovered a great ability to learn. 
Literally, it was like a breath of fresh air for me, so my next step was to cope with "Website development with HTML, CSS and base JS" course in it-academy. It was gripping to investigate something new, to deal with obstacles and challenges, to think outside the box and finally create your own first website (you can find a link below). 
Now I’m working hard at finishing "JavaScript web application development" course and thinking about advantages of The Rolling Scopes School experience.

My strong qualities: motivated and assertive, reliable, equally mastered soft skills (thanks to medicine), a team worker, can easily prioritize tasks (+multitasking), punctual (trying do things in advance) and can cope with failure.
It is a real challenge to wind me up. 
And I’m also a woman of integrity who has never abandoned her principles for the sake of making money and always kept up my end of the deal.

As I want to put the finishing touches to this part of CV, I should simply add, that focusing only on work is a bit destructive and unproductive, so I have a good work-life balance. For e.g. travelling helps to recharge my batteries and numerous hobbies make me feel refreshed.
